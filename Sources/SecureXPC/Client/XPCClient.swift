/// An XPC client to make requests and receive responses from an ``XPCServer``.
///
/// ### Retrieving a Client
/// There are two different types of services you can communicate with using this client: XPC services and XPC Mach services. If you are uncertain which
/// type of service you're using, it's likely an XPC Service.
///
/// Clients can also be created from an ``XPCServerEndpoint`` which is the only way to create a client for an anonymous server.
///
/// #### XPC services
/// These are helper tools which ship as part of your app and only your app can communicate with.
///
/// The name of the service must be specified when retrieving a client to talk to your XPC service; this is always the bundle identifier for the service:
/// ```swift
/// let client = XPCClient.forXPCService(named: "com.example.myapp.service")
/// ```
///
/// The service itself must create and configure an ``XPCServer`` by calling ``XPCServer/forThisXPCService()`` in order for this client to be able to
/// communicate with it.
///
/// #### XPC Mach services
/// Launch Agents, Launch Daemons, and helper tools installed with
/// [  `SMJobBless`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/1431078-smjobbless) can optionally communicate
/// over XPC by using Mach services.
///
/// The name of the service must be specified when retrieving a client; this must be a key in the `MachServices` entry of the tool's launchd property list:
/// ```swift
/// let client = XPCClient.forMachService(named: "com.example.service")
/// ```
/// The tool itself must retrieve and configure an ``XPCServer`` by calling ``XPCServer/forThisMachService(named:clientRequirements:)`` or
/// ``XPCServer/forThisBlessedHelperTool()`` in order for this client to be able to communicate with it.
///
/// #### Endpoints
/// Clients can be created from server endpoints:
/// ```swift
/// let server = XPCServer.makeAnonymous()
/// let client = XPCClient.forEndpoint(server.endpoint)
/// ```
/// Server endpoints can also be sent across XPC connections.
///
/// ### Sending Requests with Async
/// Once a client has been retrieved, sending a request is as simple as invoking `send` with a route:
/// ```swift
/// let resetRoute = XPCRoute.named("reset")
/// try await client.send(to: resetRoute)
/// ```
///
/// If the client needs to receive information back from the server, a route with a reply type must be used:
/// ```swift
/// let currentRoute = XPCRoute.named("config", "current")
///                            .withReplyType(Config.self)
/// let config = try await client.send(to: currentRoute)
/// ```
///
/// Routes can also require a message be included in the request:
/// ```swift
/// let updateRoute = XPCRoute.named("config", "update")
///                           .withMessageType(Config.self)
///                           .withReplyType(Config.self)
/// let config = <# create Config instance #>
/// let updatedConfig = try await client.sendMessage(config, to: updateRoute)
/// ```
///
/// ### Sending Requests with Closures
/// Closure-based versions of these functions also exist to provide support for macOS 10.14 and earlier:
/// ```swift
/// let updateRoute = XPCRoute.named("config", "update")
///                           .withMessageType(Config.self)
///                           .withReplyType(Config.self)
/// let config = <# create Config instance #>
/// client.sendMessage(config, to: updateRoute, withResponse: { response in
///     switch response {
///          case .success(let reply):
///              <# use the reply #>
///          case .failure(let error):
///              <# handle the error #>
///     }
/// })
/// ```
///
/// For these closure-based functions, the ``XPCClient/XPCResponseHandler`` provided as the `withResponse` or `onCompletion` parameter is
/// always passed a [`Result`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/result) with the `Success` value matching the route's
/// `replyType` (or `Void` if there is no reply) and a `Failure` of type ``XPCError``. If an error was thrown by the server while handling the request, it will
/// be provided as an ``XPCError`` on failure.
