/// An XPC server to receive requests from and send responses to an ``XPCClient``.
///
/// ### Retrieving a Server
/// There are two different types of services you can retrieve a server for: XPC services and XPC Mach services. If you're uncertain which type of service you're
/// using, it's likely an XPC service.
///
/// Anonymous servers can also be created which do not correspond to an XPC service or XPC Mach service.
///
/// #### XPC services
/// These are helper tools which ship as part of your app and only your app can communicate with.
///
/// To retrieve a server for an XPC service:
/// ```swift
/// let server = try XPCServer.forThisXPCService()
/// ```
///
/// #### XPC Mach services
/// Launch Daemons, Login Items, Launch Agents, and certain extensions can optionally communicate over XPC by using
/// Mach services.
///
/// Launch Daemons include helper tools installed with
/// [`SMJobBless`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/1431078-smjobbless), registered via
/// [`SMAppService.daemon(...)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/smappservice/3945410-daemon?changes=la_2),
/// or those manually registered via a property list in `/Library/LaunchDaemons/`.
///
/// In most cases, a server can be auto-configured using ``XPCServer/forThisBlessedHelperTool()`` for a helper tool installed with `SMJobBless`:
/// ```swift
/// let server = try XPCServer.forThisBlessedHelperTool()
/// ```
///
/// Similarly one registered with `SMAppService` can be auto-configured with ``XPCServer/forThisDaemon()``.
///
/// Login Items include those enabled with
/// [`SMLoginItemSetEnabled`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/1501557-smloginitemsetenabled)
/// or registered with [`SMAppService.loginItem(...)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/smappservice/3945411-loginitem). A server can be auto-configured for them
/// using ``XPCServer/forThisLoginItem()``.
///
/// For more advanced configurations as well as user other cases (such as Launch Agents) it is necessary to specify
/// both the name of the service as well its security requirements. See ``XPCServer/forThisMachService(named:clientRequirements:)`` for an example and details.
///
/// #### Anonymous servers
/// An anonymous server can be created by any macOS program. Use cases for making one include:
///  - Allowing two processes which are not XPC services to communicate over XPC with each other. This is done by having one of those processes make an
///    anonymous server and send its ``XPCNonBlockingServer/endpoint`` to an XPC Mach service. The other process then needs to retrieve that
///    endpoint from the XPC Mach service and create a client using ``XPCClient/forEndpoint(_:)``.
///  - Testing code that would otherwise run as part of an XPC Mach service without needing to install a helper tool. However, note that this code won't run as root.
///
/// ### Registering & Handling Routes
/// Once a server instance has been retrieved, one or more routes should be registered with it. This is done by calling one of the `registerRoute` functions and
/// providing a route and a compatible closure or function. For example:
/// ```swift
///     ...
///     let updateRoute = XPCRoute.named("config", "update")
///                               .withMessageType(Config.self)
///                               .withReplyType(Config.self)
///     server.registerRoute(updateRoute, handler: updateConfig)
/// }
///
/// private func updateConfig(_ config: Config) throws -> Config {
///     <# implementation here #>
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Routes with sequential reply types can respond to the client arbitrarily many times and therefore must explicitly provide responses to a
/// ``SequentialResultProvider``:
/// ```swift
///     ...
///     let changesRoute = XPCRoute.named("config", "changes")
///                                .withSequentialReplyType(Config.self)
///     server.registerRoute(changesRoute, handler: configChanges)
/// }
///
/// private func configChanges(provider: SequentialResultProvider<Config>) {
///     <# implementation here #>
/// }
/// ```
///
/// On macOS 10.15 and later async functions and closures can also be registered as the handler for a route. For command line tools, such as the helper tools
/// installed with `SMJobBless`, async functions and closures are only supported on macOS 12 and later. This is an
/// [Apple limitation](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/701969) unrelated to SecureXPC.
///
/// ### Starting a Server
/// Once all of the routes are registered, the server must be told to start processing requests. In most cases this should be done with:
/// ```swift
/// server.startAndBlock()
/// ```
///
/// Returned server instances which conform to ``XPCNonBlockingServer`` can also be started in a non-blocking manner:
/// ```swift
/// server.start()
/// ```
