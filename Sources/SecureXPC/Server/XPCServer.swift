/// An XPC server to receive requests from and send responses to an ``XPCClient``.
///
/// ### Retrieving a Server
/// There are two different types of services you can retrieve a server for: XPC services and XPC Mach services. If you're uncertain which type of service you're
/// using, it's likely an XPC service.
///
/// Anonymous servers can also be created which do not correspond to an XPC service or XPC Mach service.
///
/// #### XPC services
/// These are helper tools which ship as part of your app and only your app can communicate with.
///
/// To retrieve a server for an XPC service:
/// ```swift
/// let server = try XPCServer.forThisXPCService()
/// ```
///
/// #### XPC Mach services
/// Launch Agents, Launch Daemons, and helper tools installed with
/// [`SMJobBless`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/1431078-smjobbless) can optionally communicate
/// over XPC by using Mach services.
///
/// In most cases, a server can be auto-configured for a helper tool installed with `SMJobBless`:
/// ```swift
/// let server = try XPCServer.forThisBlessedHelperTool()
/// ```
/// See ``XPCServer/forThisBlessedHelperTool()`` for the exact requirements which need to be met.
///
/// For Launch Agents, Launch Daemons, more advanced `SMJobBless` helper tool configurations, as well as other cases it is necessary both to the specify the
/// name of the service as well its security requirements. See ``XPCServer/forThisMachService(named:clientRequirements:)`` for an example and
/// details.
///
/// #### Anonymous servers
/// An anonymous server can be created by any macOS program. Use cases for making one include:
///  - Allowing two processes which are not XPC services to communicate over XPC with each other. This is done by having one of those processes make an
///    anonymous server and send its ``NonBlockingServer/endpoint`` to an XPC Mach service. The other process then needs to retrieve that endpoint
///    from the XPC Mach service and create a client using ``XPCClient/forEndpoint(_:)``.
///  - Testing code that would otherwise run as part of an XPC Mach service without needing to install a helper tool. However, note that this code won't run as root.
///
/// ### Registering & Handling Routes
/// Once a server instance has been retrieved, one or more routes should be registered with it. This is done by calling one of the `registerRoute` functions and
/// providing a route and a compatible closure or function. For example:
/// ```swift
///     ...
///     let updateConfigRoute = XPCRoute.named("update", "config")
///                                     .withMessageType(Config.self)
///                                     .withReplyType(Config.self)
///     server.registerRoute(updateConfigRoute, handler: updateConfig)
/// }
///
/// private func updateConfig(_ config: Config) throws -> Config {
///     <# implementation here #>
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Starting a Server
/// Once all of the routes are registered, the server must be told to start processing requests. In most cases this should be done with:
/// ```swift
/// server.startAndBlock()
/// ```
///
/// Returned server instances which conform to ``NonBlockingServer`` can also be started in a non-blocking manner:
/// ```swift
/// server.start()
/// ```
