import Foundation

/// Sends sequential responses to an ``XPCClient`` for a specific route.
///
/// Instances of this class are provided to handlers registered with an ``XPCServer`` for routes with sequential reply types:
/// - Async without a message — ``XPCServer/registerRoute(_:handler:)-6sxby``
/// - Async with a message — ``XPCServer/registerRoute(_:handler:)-7ngxn``
/// - Synchronous without a message — ``XPCServer/registerRoute(_:handler:)-7r1hv``
/// - Synchronous with a message — ``XPCServer/registerRoute(_:handler:)-qcox``
///
/// It is valid to use an instance of this class outside of the closure it was provided to. Responses will be sent so long as the client remains connected and the
/// sequence has not already been finished.
///
/// Any errors generated while using this provider will be passed to the ``XPCServer``'s error handler.
///
/// All results sent to the client including finishing a sequence are enqueued and sent asynchronously. For example a call to ``success(value:onDelivery:)``
/// may return before the result has actually been sent. To determine whether the client has actually received the result either call the `async` version such as
/// ``success(value:)`` or pass a ``SequentialResultDeliveryHandler`` to  ``success(value:onDelivery:)``. This can be particularly
/// useful in applying back pressure to the system to prevent the client from accumulating too many yet to be processed results. However, if this behavior is not
/// needed then do not use the `async` versions as `await`ing them will always wait on client delivery (unless an error occurs).
///
/// Once a sequence has been either explicitly finished or finishes because of an encoding error, any subsequent operations will not be sent and
/// ``XPCError/sequenceFinished`` will be passed to the error handler. If a sequence was not already finished, it will be finished upon deinitialization of this
/// provider instance.
///
/// While provider instances are thread-safe, attempting concurrent responses may lead to inconsistent ordering on the client side. If exact ordering is necessary, it is
/// recommended that callers synchronize access to a provider instance.
